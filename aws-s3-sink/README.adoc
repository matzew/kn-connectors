= Knative connector aws-s3-sink

Knative eventing connector based on https://camel.apache.org/camel-kamelets/[Apache Camel Kamelets].
The connector project creates a container image that is pushed into a registry so the image can be referenced in a Kubernetes deployment.

== Kamelet properties

The kn-connector source images provides these properties that you can set (e.g. via environment properties on the deployment).

.Kamelet properties
include::properties.adoc[]

== Kubernetes manifest

The build produces a Kubernetes manifest in (`target/kubernetes/kubernetes.yml`).
This manifest holds all resources required to run the application on your Kubernetes cluster.

You can customize the Kubernetes resources in link:src/main/kubernetes/kubernetes.yml[src/main/kubernetes/kubernetes.yml].
This is being used as a basis and Quarkus will generate the final manifest in `target/kubernetes/kubernetes.yml` during the build.

The final Kubernetes manifest includes:

* Service
* Deployment
* SinkBinding

== Kamelet source Pipe

The source produces events for the Knative broker.
It uses an Apache Camel Pipe resource as the central piece of code to define how the Knative events are produced.

The Pipe is a YAML file located in link:src/main/resources/camel/kn-connector-source.yaml[src/main/resources/camel/kn-connector-source.yaml]

.kn-connector-source.yaml

  name: kn-connector-aws-s3-sink
spec:
  source:
    ref:
      apiVersion: camel.apache.org/v1
      kind: Kamelet
      name: aws-s3-sink
  sink:
    dataTypes:
      in:

      kind: Broker
      name: default
----

This connector uses the https://camel.apache.org/camel-kamelets/aws-s3-sink.html[aws-s3-sink] Kamelet that produces events for the Knative broker.

The Pipe references the Kamelet as a source and connects to the Knative broker as a sink.

The name of the broker is always `default` because the actual broker URL is injected into the application via `SinkBinding` resource.
The SinkBinding injects a `K_SINK` environment variable to the deployment and the application uses the injected broker URL to send events to it.

This way the same container image can be used with different brokers.
It is only a matter of configuring the SinkBinding resource that connects the application with the Knative broker.

You can find a sample SinkBinding in link:src/main/kubernetes/kubernetes.yml[src/main/kubernetes/kubernetes.yml]

== Configuration

Each Kamelet defines a set of properties.
The user is able to customize these properties when running a connector deployment.

=== Environment variables

You can customize the properties via environment variables on the deployment:

.Environment variables
include::properties.adoc[]

The environment variables that overwrite properties on the Kamelet source follow a naming convention:

* CAMEL_KAMELET_{{KAMELET_NAME}}_{{PROPERTY_NAME}}={{PROPERTY_VALUE}}

The name represents the name of the Kamelet as defined in the https://camel.apache.org/camel-kamelets/[Kamelet catalog].

The environment variables may be set as part of the Kubernetes deployment or as an alternative on the Knative ContainerSource:

[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: sources.knative.dev/v1
kind: ContainerSource
metadata:
  name: kamelet-source
spec:
  template:
    spec:
      containers:
        - image: quay.io/openshift-knative/kn-connector-aws-s3-sink:1.0
          name: aws-s3
          env:
            - name: CAMEL_KAMELET_{{KAMELET_NAME}}_{{PROPERTY_NAME}}
              value: "my-value"
  sink:
    ref:
      apiVersion: eventing.knative.dev/v1
      kind: Broker
      name: default
----

You can also set the environment variable on the running deployment:

[source,shell]
----
kubectl set env deployment/kn-connector-{{source-name}} CAMEL_KAMELET_{{KAMELET_NAME}}_{{PROPERTY_NAME}}="I updated it..."
----

=== ConfigMap and Secret

You may also mount a configmap/secret to overwrite Kamelet properties with values from the configmap/secret resource.

As the Kamelet properties are configured viw environment variables on the ContainerSource you can also use values referencing a configmap or secret.

[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: sources.knative.dev/v1
kind: ContainerSource
metadata:
  name: kamelet-source
  namespace: knative-samples
spec:
  template:
    spec:
      containers:
        - image: quay.io/openshift-knative/kn-connector-aws-s3-sink:1.0
          name: aws-s3
          env:
            - name: CAMEL_KAMELET_{{KAMELET_NAME}}_{{PROPERTY_NAME}}
              valueFrom:
                secretKeyRef:
                  name: my-secret
                  key: my-propertyvalue
  sink:
    ref:
      apiVersion: eventing.knative.dev/v1
      kind: Broker
      name: default
----

The example above references a secret called `my-secret` and loads the key `my-property-value`.
